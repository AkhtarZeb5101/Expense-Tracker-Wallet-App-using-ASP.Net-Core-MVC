# 🚀 Semester Project! 🚀 

Just wrapped up my Visual Programming semester project – an Expense Tracker Web App using ASP.NET Core MVC! 💻💰 
While I’m not the biggest fan of .NET, this project was a great learning experience. 

## The app helps users: 
✅ Manage expense categories (e.g., Food, Rent). 

✅ Record transactions with details like amount, date, and category. 

✅ View spending trends via a dashboard and reports. 

## Tech Stack: 

### ASP.NET Core MVC

- SQL Server (Database) 
- Entity Framework Core (Database Management) 
- Syncfusion UI (Modern Interface) 

## Highlights: 
- Handles 10,000+ transactions smoothly. 
- Secure authentication and role-based access. 
- Complies with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR). 

This project pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me a lot about web development with .NET. 💡

Project configuration tutorial is in the GitHub Repo in the form of a video.
